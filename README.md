# CN-LAB-1
 EXPERIMENT 1 – Introduction to Cisco Packet Tracer
 Objective:
To understand the basic interface and functionality of Cisco Packet Tracer and get familiar with its components for creating simple network topologies.
 Tools Required:
Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.x recommended)

Computer with Windows/Linux/macOS

Internet connection (for download/updates)
 Theory:
Cisco Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulation tool developed by Cisco Systems. It allows students and professionals to simulate complex networks without the need for physical hardware. It provides drag-and-drop functionality to create network topologies and test configurations such as IP addressing, routing protocols, VLANs, etc.

 Procedure:
Open Cisco Packet Tracer.

Familiarize with the Interface:

Device-Type Selection Box

Workspace Area

Topology Panel

Simulation vs Realtime Mode

Add Devices:

Drag routers, switches, and PCs into the workspace.

Connect Devices:

Use appropriate cables (copper straight-through/crossover).

Configure Devices:

Assign IP addresses.

Test connectivity using the ping command.

 Result:
Successfully created a basic network topology and tested connectivity using Cisco Packet Tracer.
